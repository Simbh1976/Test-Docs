# Getting Started

To start the session, you have to launch the Platform1 Server application. The server is a dedicated computer on a network that manages the access control system database. It is used to receive incoming transactions and dispatch information from server to remote client application. Platform1 remote client application enable user to access and program the system database and components via a remote workstation which connected to the network. User may manage the server directly on the server computer or via remote client computer which connected to the network.

There are 2 editions to Entrypass Platform1 Server software:

### Difference between System and TA User

* System User: can access on all the system database like card adding, controller adding and etc. 
* TA User: can only view the time attendance records

{% hint style="warning" %}
All authorized users must have a unique and confidential login name and password that should be assigned by the system administrator. It is very important to restrict access to the ENTRYPASS remote client application to authorized personnel only. The default username and password is "EntryPass". \(Username and password are case sensitive\)
