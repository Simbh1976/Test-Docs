# Getting Started

To start the session, please launch the Platform1 Server application.

Within the topics highlighted on the table of contents, are various 'basic' settings that you can configure to further suit the demands of your organisation. 

As this is a basic level guide, certain advanced features will be excluded from discussion while to fully utilise it's capability, it would be advisable to visit the 'Platform1 Server Manual' \(refer to quick note 1\) to have a complete understanding on it's features.
