## Quick note

1. There are several card types that can be configured for an Access Card. Below are some of the explanation on the card types: 

* **Normal \(Access Card\)**: Such cards are being used for normal access control only. 
* **Special \(Arm / Disarm\)**: Such card will allow a user to ‘Arm’ or ‘Disarm’ an alarm point only. 
* **Master \(Master Card\)**: This card will be used as an Access Control card IN ADDITION, it can bypass Antipassback System and Card + Pin System. 
* **Maintenance \(Maintenance Card\)**: When this card is flashed at the reader terminal, it will set the terminal to ‘Maintenance Mode’. Under maintenance mode, any temper alarms that had been set on the reader will be temporarily unarmed. Once maintenance is completed on the reader and this card is flashed again on the reader terminal, the temper alarm will be rearmed.
