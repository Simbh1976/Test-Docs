#### STEP 5 & COMPLETE: Proceed to ‘Zone Setting’ Tab’ and set the ‘Maximum In-Count’ \(the maximum number of users within the selected zone\) number to your required value. By default, the system will set a maximum in count of 30,000 \(refer to Quick Note 2\). Click ‘Accept’ when done and the selected readers will be configured with Access Limit Feature. Once all steps have been completed, the system will begin to keep track the number of staffs within a 'zone'.

## Quick Note

1. In principle, both readers \(Entry & Exit\) should be enabled with Access Limit feature so that it will allow the readers to keep track of the number of users within a single zone. Whenever a user enter a zone with Access Limit enabled, it ‘increases \(add\)’ the user count within that zone itself and when the user limit has reached, it will prevent others from entering that zone. The door will only resume to allow others to enter when users exit the zone and the exit reader ‘decreases \(subtract\) the number of users within that zone. IF either the exit or entry reader is not enabled with Access Limit feature, it will not be able to keep track of the number of users within a single zone.
2. Depending on the number of persons that you would like to limit within a zone / area, set the corresponding number into the box for **that zone only**.
