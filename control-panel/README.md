# Control Panel

This section will highlight some of the basic settings that you may find useful to an organisations' security protocols. 

## Add New Control Panel

Before proceeding further into the next section, it is important for you to take note that you would need to obtain the **network address** and **port number** of the control panel that you're going to add into the server. To obtain the network address, you can either:

1. get the network address and port number from your System Installer \(SI\) OR
2. follow the method outlined in the manual 'QUICK START-UP GUIDE' in page 3.

The network address and port number is needed for setting up purposes as it is an important piece of information that will resolve the addressing needs of the server. 

## Enabling AES Encryption and changing AES User Key

The Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\), also known by its original name Rijndael \(Dutch pronunciation: \[ˈrɛindaːl\]\), is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) in 2001 and is widely adopted by the U.S. Government and worldwide. Within the Control Panel, you can choose to have the data stored to be encrypted with this encryption system so as to secure your data from other third party view. 

Due to the nature of the system where the algorithm is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data, it is IMPORTANT that you need to take note and have proper safe keeping of your User Keys.
