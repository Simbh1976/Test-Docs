# Control Panel

Before proceeding further into the next section, it is important for you to take note that you would need to obtain the **network address** and **port number** of the control panel that you're going to add into the server. To obtain the network address, you can either:

1. get the network address and port number from your System Installer \(SI\) OR
2. follow the method outlined in the manual 'QUICK START-UP GUIDE' in page 3.

The network address and port number is needed for setting up purposes as it is an important piece of information that will resolve the addressing needs of the server.
