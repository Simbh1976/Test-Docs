# How to create Normal Shift in Time Attendance

## List of Steps

STEP 1: Proceed to Control Panel tab and click ‘Time Attendance’.

STEP 2: Click on ‘Normal Shift’.

STEP 3: Click ‘Add’

STEP 4: Provide a name and description to the normal shift that you are going to add. You may provide a ‘colour’ to this Day Shift to provide easy visual identification.

STEP 5: Key in the ‘Work Time’, ‘Break Time’ and ‘Minimum Work Hour’. If ‘Deduct Minutes’ is applicable, then key in the time period. If there are overtime involved, tick the ‘OT Claims’ checkbox to yes. \*

STEP 6: Click ‘Save and Close’.

STEP 7: Return to Control Panel and click ‘Company’.

STEP 8: Click ‘Staff’.

STEP 9: List and choose the staff that you would like to allocate the Normal Shift by using Filter View or Classic View.

STEP 10: Click ‘Edit \(F4\)’.

STEP 11: Under ‘Shift Type’, tick ‘Normal’.

STEP 12 & COMPLETE: Click on the pull down menu and choose the Normal shift that the staff belongs to. Once complete, click ‘Accept’. Time Attendance for the particular staff will be active.

## Quick Note

There is an additional column ‘Deduct \(mins\)’ where this feature will CONSISTENTLY deduct the total number of hours worked for this staff on whichever the day that this feature is enabled.
